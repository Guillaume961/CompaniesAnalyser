In addition to programs specifically for use on single workstations, Avira primarily offers professional solutions for cross-system protection of networks on various levels. These include products for workstations, file, mail and web servers. Gateway computers can be managed as workstation computers via a central management console for all operating systems. In addition to the management products of the individual solutions, security programs for PDAs, smartphones and embedded devices are also offered. Our clients include renowned national and international corporations, educational institutions and public clients. Avira AntiVir Personal, used by millions of private users, represents a significant contribution to security.</p>nn<p>In Tettnang, near the Lake Constance Avira is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs. The company has several locations in Germany and partnerships in Europe, Asia and America. Worldwide approximately 300 persons are employed. Dozens of researchers in various virus labs attend to local and global threats on the virus front around the clock. This work is acknowledged, for example, by several test awards with the VB 100% of the Virus Bulletin or by repeated TÃœV certification.</p>nn<p>As a technological leader in the Unix market, Avira develops leading-edge standards. Other Avira innovations include virus protection solutions for Symbian and the worldâ€™s first SAP-certified virus protection.</p>nn<p>In addition to intelligent technologies, Avira offers solution-oriented advice and individual support from our own experts under the motto â€œMore than Securityâ€. Protection of users with Avira AntiVir Personal represents a significant contribution to security and a further additional firewall for corporate networks.</p>nn<p>Awards and certifications of the Avira products and partnerships with corporations such as IBM, Sun, Novell, AVM or Clearswift underline the efficiency and core competency of the company. Security solutions from Avira are in demand worldwide and immediately available locally via trained, authorized partners.</p>nn<p>Distributed all over the world, many integration partners directly implement the Avira AntiVir scan engine â€œSavapiâ€ in OEM products. Savapi and the underlying scanning technology are characterized by cross-platform and processor-independent programming. This includes use with Windows and Linux as well as on Intel and non-Intel processors. Thanks to the use of resource-saving programming technologies, Avira products have low RAM requirements.</p>nn<p>In addition, Avira constantly adapts to the current security requirements of the users. AntiVir is therefore one of the worlds first ever products with dialer detection. This dialer detection was very quickly followed by the detection and removal of adware and spyware. Current developments in this field include the detection of already active root kits. The introduction of a firewall and behavior blockers is a matter of course. In-house development also allows the development of various new special scanning technologies, for example for PDAs, handhelds and embedded devices.</p>nn<p>Aviraâ€™s national and international customers include renowned corporations listed on the stock exchange but also educational institutions and public authorities.

Its initial product is Semanti, a web service that enhances and personalizes the search engine experience by delivering more relevant and meaningful search results, based on individuals&#8217; previous searches, as well as their trusted friends and the Semanti community&#8217;s results. Semanti is currently available as a Firefox add-on and works seamlessly with the Google, Yahoo! and Bing search engines. The company is headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. For more information, visit www.semanti.com.</p>nn<p>Product:nSemanti is a search enhancement tool that provides users with smart social search&#8211;the ability to help Internet users find, retrieve and share more relevant information faster and easier than ever before. Semanti employs a unique semantic-based search methodology that integrates with Facebook Connect to allow users to search at a social level, and offers new tools for personalized searches. A free browser plug-in, Semanti works with all industry-leading search engines (including Microsoft Bing), so users do not have to change their existing search behaviors. </p>nn<p>Social Search:nA user simply downloads the free Semanti plug-in and invites their Facebook Friends to do so as well. Using their preferred search engines like Google, Microsoft Bing and Yahoo!, friends click on links they find relevant to their inquiries. Then when an individual conducts a search based on a specific topic, the friends&#8217; results and recommendations appear at the top of their search engine results marked as being endorsed by their Facebook friends. For example, a user searching for a new restaurant will benefit from seeing which restaurants their Facebook friends have researched and saved. A restaurant recommended by a friend has far more relevance to an individual than one that shows up in a general web search. </p>nn<p>Personal Search:nSemanti tools like MyWeb create a personal search engine experience. When users find a page they like, they simply click on a button to save it so it is easy to find again later. Unlike bookmarks or favorites, MyWeb stores the entire page&#8217;s text along with the user&#8217;s search terms. Later, when the user is searching for the page again, they can find it using their preferred search engine-Semanti will search the text on the user&#8217;s saved pages as well as the search terms originally used to find those pages and then display matching results above the usual search engine results. Because the pages are saved by Semanti, the user can access them from any computer without having to worry about whether or not their bookmarks or favorites are on located on a particular computer.</p>nn<p>Better Search:nSemanti improves the overall search experience through its innovative and unique semantic-based search methodology. Semanti Suggest(TM) helps users specify the exact meaning of their search terms via a drop-down menu. As a result, users receive results that match what they mean rather than what they say, eliminating ambiguity. Semanti also knows there are many different ways that people can say the same thing. Semanti understands that &#8216;Store&#8217;, &#8216;Shop&#8217; and &#8216;Retailer&#8217; generally mean the same thing so regardless of which search term the user chooses, Semanti will ensure that the user receives the best results. Once individuals find a result they like, that person simply clicks on a button to save the page, marking it as relevant. Each approved web page becomes available to the Semanti community, enriching everyone&#8217;s search experience. This approach uses the &#8216;wisdom of the crowds&#8217; to sort out the relevant pages from the inappropriate.</p>nn<p>Consumers can download and install the free browser plug-in at www.semanti.com.

The foundersâ€™ detailed knowledge and understanding of carrier billing was formed from many years spent selling and integrating carrier services.</p>nn<p>In 2005, this knowledge base became Total Telecom Consulting. In all their years working on the carrier sales side of the industry, the founders identified a clear need in the marketplace for consulting designed to help fiscal managers within organizations streamline and understand the telecom &amp; Tech line items of their P&amp;L.</p>nn<p>Recent trends show that clients need to reduce budgets in order to justify needed projects or purchases. Discovering that most CFO&#8217;s and Controllers responsible for managing organizational expense rarely possess the amount of time or skill set necessary to track down all the anomalies characteristic of telecom billing.n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>nn<p>In today&#8217;s business climate all businesses have some sort of pain when it comes to telecom services, and Total Telecom Consulting business model truly addresses these pains. After many years of representing specific products to prospects it was realized that this approach was totally incorrect. How can you expect to  truly help customers when you are carrying commitments to specific vendors with specific products? Every customer has a very unique situation and your business model must adapt and change to address each clients unique needs and goals on a continuous basis. </p>nn<p>Total Telecom Consulting is now positioned as a non exclusive partner to every major carrier and vendor in the marketplace both nationally and internationally, and our firm carries no revenue commitments with these carriers or vendors as many telecom agencies do. This provides a totally unbiased pool of resources to benefit customers with customized solutions and services. I hope that provides you with a little insight as to how Total Telecom Consulting differs from the typical telecom agency. Total Telecom Consulting handles all bid processes, procurement, and if needed project and services management on the clients behalf. We eliminate the need to meet with multiple sales people, without taking away the confidence that you&#8217;ve looked at all the options. Our services provide an expert single point of contact for all telecom and technology related processes and projects. </p>nn<p>There are no scenarios where we try to make a product work (square peg round hole) to fit a customers need. Total Telecom Consulting does however target the customers business processes, needs, and from there the correct product sets are discovered that will provide and address needs thus improving business processes. Total Telecom also handles many private bid processes for contractors and corporate relocation specialists who have telecom cabling/fiber and or infrastructure built into specific projects, this provides them with expert insight and a single point of contact for RFP&#8217;s, project management, and forward management. </p>nn<p>Other focuses of Total Telecom Consulting business model are business continuity, disaster / telecom recovery, and Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢. These services are truly setting a standard of excellence leaving clients much less vulnerable to outages and lost revenues due to outages or data loss. The Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢ portion shelters the customer from incorrect billings and provides prompt recovery of incorrect billings. Most organizations that are driven to being progressive and value Unbiased insight into these pains find tremendous value, especially in instances where they cannot afford or are not getting results needed with an internal technology staff member*. In regard to Total Telecom Expense Managementâ„¢ we have provided a few snippets from our website that  provides insight into how the industry has progressed and why there is such an overwhelming demand for these services. </p>", "deadpooled_year":null, "category_code":"consulting", "competitions":[], "ipo":null, "deadpooled_day":null, "funding_rounds":[], "number_of_employees":null, "email_address":"rstevens@totaltelecomconsulting.com", "partners":[], "external_links":[{"external_url":"http://totaltelecomconsulting.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/interview-with-robert-stevens-founder-and-ceo-of-pittsburgh-based-total-telecom-consulting/","title":"Interview with Robert Stevens Founder and CEO of Pittsburgh Based Total Telecom Consulting"}, {"external_url":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/robertlstevens","title":"President & CEO Robert STevens LinkedIN profile"}], "name":"Total Telecom Consulting", "phone_number":"4124500005", "providerships":[], "idKey":18595, "permalink":"total-telecom-consulting", "milestones":[], "acquisitions":[]}
